    <p>Hello, my name is Dean Weiss. I graduated Highschool in 2004 and enlisted in the Minnesota National Guard in 2006. Since I have been in the military for over 15
        years my job experience primarily consists of working for the Minnesota National Guard in some capacity. Be it on active duty orders in preperation for a deployment or
        as a federal technician, doing administrative work. Because my skillset revolves around the military my goal is to complete the suite of tasks here at CodeFellows and
        make my self marketable in the wider world as a coder.
